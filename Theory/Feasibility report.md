- # Operational Feasibility
  collapsed:: true
	- The Operational feasibility of a solution aims to evaluate whether each proposed solution to a problem will work in practice and solve the problem that is posed. All of the requirements that I stated in my problem definition as well as Needs and objectives are all very achievable. This concludes that this project this is feasible in an operational sense.
- # Technical Feasibility
  collapsed:: true
	- The technical feasibility of a solution regards the availability of the hardware and software that the project requires. It also involves the ability to operate with other technologies and the technical expertise required by the users to effectively use the application. All of the required technologies of this project are already familiar to me. These include the language python and its library pygame ~~how does pygame work~~, visual studio code as an IDE and git along with GitHub as source control. This means that this project is definitely feasible.
- # Economic Feasibility
  collapsed:: true
	- The economic feasibility of a solution refers to the the potential for an application to profit along with the budgeting of the project. Considering the fact that is project is written by me, and nothing is being bought to develop this application, there isn't any cost to this project other than the time invested. This means that the Economic factors of this project doesn't need to be taken into consideration when evaluating the feasibility of this project.
- # Scheduling Feasibility
  collapsed:: true
	- The Schedule feasibility of a project considers whether the solution can be completed on time. Tools like project plan and in particular, a Gantt chart, will help specify the deadlines for completion for each different section of a solution. Due to the requirements stated in the problem definition, this project should easily be able to be completed in the allocated 7 weeks. ~~yet i insist on doing it all in the last week ~~
- # Feasibility Conclusion
  collapsed:: true
	- Overall, there are no factors that lead to this project being un-feasible. The problems that this application aim to solve are achievable, All of the technical requirements can be met. There are no economic factors that can stop this application and the time allocated for this project provides a workable time-frame to complete this project.
