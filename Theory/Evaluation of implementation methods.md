- # Direct conversion
	- Direct conversion is an instant transfer from an old system to a new system. The old system is rendered useless once the conversion has happened and all users are forced to use the new system.
	- Advantages:
		- Quick, Changes happen instantly
		- Cheap, No need to run two systems simultaneously
		- Easy for management, Only one system to deal with
	- Disadvantages:
		- New system must work for all users and fulfil the old systems role.
		- All data must be compatible with the new system. High chance of damage to data
		- Inadequate training on the use of the new system can shock/annoy users
		- High workload for management staff

- # Parallel conversion
	- The parallel conversion method involves running both systems simultaneously for a certain amount of time. The new system will be brought in at full scale and the old system will remain at full scale for a certain amount of time. Once that time has ended, The old system will be taken away and all users will be forced onto the new system.
	-
	- Advantages:
		- Allows the users to choose when they transfer over to the new system
		- Allows for any errors and oversights in the new system to be identified and fixed
		- Low chance of any data loss
	- Disadvantages:
		- Expensive to have both systems running at the same time
		- Data needs to be synced between both systems. If this isn't done, data can be inconsistent and incorrect
		- Allows for users to not use the new system, meaning they will be unprepared for the cut-off date.

- # Phased conversion
	- The Phased conversion is a combination of the parallel and direct conversion. It involves certain elements being phased out from the old system and replaced by parts of the new system.
	- Advantages:
		- Lots of time for users to learn the new system, part by part
		- Users are forced to use the new system
		- No duplicate functionality across systems
		- The same task can't be completed on both systems meaning there is no duplicate functionality
		- Only certain elements can be used if some elements aren't ready or are not sufficient
		- Elements can be implemented when it suits the user
	- Disadvantages:
		- Difficult to maintain the system
		- Both systems must work together
		- Expensive as both systems need to run at the same time
		- Data needs to be kept consistent while in use by both systems
		- Inconvenient for users as they need to switch systems often

- # Pilot conversion
	- The Pilot conversion involves a small group of users as a "pilot" or trial. This allows developers to fix any issues with the new system before the new system is rolled out to the entire user-base.
	- Advantages:
		- Any errors in the new application can be fixed before the entire user-base uses the new software.
		- These errors will only affect a small number of users
	- Disadvantages:
		- Expensive as both systems need to run at the same time
		- This method only works with large user-bases
		- Data needs to be kept consistent while in use by both systems
		
- # Recommended implementation
	- Due to the nature of this application, the direct conversion is the only implementation method that is effective.
	- This is due to:
		- Very small user base
		- Small scale system
		- Low budge
		- No pre-existing or replaceable system to be phased out
