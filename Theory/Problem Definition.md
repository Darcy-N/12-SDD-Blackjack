# Problem Definition
### Darcy Nielson
- The problem this task aims to solve is the lack of twists and different variations of the classic game of blackjack. This task also aims to improve the developer's skills, mainly incorporating object-orientated programming. This task contains a few components that need to be implemented along with implementing a twist on the original blackjack. This task is great for teaching developers the importance of OOP and how it can be used to heavily optimise code.

- First, the blackjack game needs to incorporate all of the core elements. These include:
	- Basic hit and standing elements.
	- Varying bet sizing
	- Double implementation
	- Players to play with
	- A dealer to play against
		- The dealer needs to follow standard dealer rules (eg. Hits up to 16, stands on 17)
			- This behaviour can be tweaked by the player
		- The dealer can shuffle the shoe that contains multiple decks.
